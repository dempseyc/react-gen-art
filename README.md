This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I give you a display, a UI, interfacing each other.  I think it's fun.  This is a way for me to learn about how React works with the DOM, deals with classes, etc.  In the exploration, I built my own image based drop-down option selection, while trying out and reading about how I could implement it with various libraries I could have used, but didn't.  All this does is help someone generate some raw materials.
